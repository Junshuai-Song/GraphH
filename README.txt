README: GraphH
--------------

GraphH is an open-source library for scalable in-database analytics.
We hope to establish a high availability and scalable graph algorithm framework 
based on the relational database. It use the vertex centered model that is similar 
to Giraph.
It provides data-parallel implementations of Graph Algorithm for Directed 
and Undirected data.

See the project web site located at http://.... for links to the latest 
source packages.

For installation guides, please see the GraphH_Install file.
For contribution guides, please see the GraphH_Contribution file.

There is no any third-party libraries.

NOTE: This open-source library is based on HAWQ.
